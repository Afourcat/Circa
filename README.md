Circa - Efficient Logic Simulation
==================================

Circa is a logic simulator that aims to be efficient in both edition and
execution of logic circuits.

<!-- TODO: Add build status -->

Why Circa?
----------

Logic simulation software is either very expensive or unmaintained. On top of
that, most of these have further limitations that might restrict a lot of
projects or a very confusing UI.

We aim to build a free, open-source tool with acceptable efficiency and user
accessibility.

Planned Features
----------------

 - [ ] Multibit nets **without** direction
 - [ ] User-made circuits as components
 - [ ] Stepped, monitorable simulation
 - [ ] Grid-based editor

Built with Love and...
----------------------

 - [The Rust Language](https://rustlang.org/)
